While I lived in Rwanda, the importance of water became clearer to me than it ever has. On days when we did not have running water at our house, we were unable to use the shower or the toilet. We were unable to wash our clothes, to stay clean. We could not boil pasta or make a cup of tea. Yes, some issues seem more trivial than others, \nbut for someone who has always had water readily available through a tap, the lack of tea can be the drop that makes the cup run over!',

This might not seem a big factor on its own, but it prevented many girls from going to school, especially during their period. Missing out on days of learning every month takes its toll in the long run, and many girls struggle to \nkeep up. It was not only the lack of running water that influenced access to education. Some days it was the excess of water that made us all, teachers and students alike, unable to learn. The rainy season in Rwanda lasts for months every year. The rain pounds heavily on the metal roofs of our schools, making a noise so loud that it is impossible to listen to anything else. When it rains for days, the mud roads turn into rivers. Without paved roads, it can be impossible to make it to school.\nSome days, the muddy rivers were so strong, that we could not even make it out of our house. Access to education depends on numerous factors. \nOften it is not a case of building a school and shipping in books, but of building infrastructure, of securing an area, of ensuring running water. Development is an intricate process. The next time someone talks about “access to education”, you should think about that.',
